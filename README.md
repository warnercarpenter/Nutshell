Group project at Nashville Software School. We were tasking with a creating a single-page application using vanilla Javasript which allows a user to store tasks, event, and articles to a database which is dynamically displayed on the DOM. Users can also chat with each other via a chat box and add each other as friends. Friends can see each others events and articles.
